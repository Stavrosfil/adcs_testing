# ADCS Testing

This is an `MPU9250` remote testing framework based on `ESP32 Arduino Core` and `PlatformIO`.

It utilizes bluetooth to establish `remote serial` communication with `Matlab` running on a remote computer, which controls and collects the data.

* `/src` is where the actual code is located for now.
It will later be based on a better and cleaner code for bluetooth.
